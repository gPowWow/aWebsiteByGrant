    "text": "Up above, is a graph I found from Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigative Report, which can be accessed at: https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/introduction/ It’s a graph that shows which types of data breaches have become more or less common over a span of six years from 2017-2023. The types of data breaches listed and categorized in the graph are “denial of service,” “privilege misuse,” “system intrusion,” “basic web application attacks,” “social engineering,” “lost and stolen assets,” “miscellaneous errors,” and “everything else.” There are some pros and cons I have discovered about this graph:\nPros\n\nIt looks at the fluctuations in the amount of a particular data breach over a span of months per year based on monthly averages instead of over a span of days or weeks in order to fit all the data into the small space that the graph covers.\nIt ensures that the viewer and reader of this graph is able to distinguish which line refers to a specific data breach category by matching them based on color.\n\nCons\n\nUsing colors is not necessarily the best way to separate the lines from each other and match a specific data breach category with a specific line. It cannot be assumed that everybody has normal color vision. There are too many cool colors, especially green, blue, and different hues of purple that make it hard for the eye to focus and differentiate the lines from each other. On the light spectrum, the human eye can see the colors green pretty well and the color red fairly well, but not the color blue. We have fewer cones in our eyes that pick up the color blue and, as a result, have to focus more on texts and details that are in the color blue or blended in with a blue background.\nThe text of the data breach category “basic web application attacks” is in a bright yellow color that can make it hard to see and read.\n\nThe best solution for presenting this graph is to either incorporate some more warmer and brighter colors to provide more contrast and differentiation between the colors to help the viewer and reader distinguish which line belongs to which data breach category. Or, create different types of lines such as dotted and broken lines, for example, which I recommend, instead of colored lines."

    "text": "Up above, is a graph I found from Verizon’s 2023 Data Breach Investigative Report, which can be accessed at: https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2023/introduction/ It’s a graph that shows which types of data breaches have become more or less common over a span of six years from 2017-2023. The types of data breaches listed and categorized in the graph are “denial of service,” “privilege misuse,” “system intrusion,” “basic web application attacks,” “social engineering,” “lost and stolen assets,” “miscellaneous errors,” and “everything else.” There are some pros and cons I have discovered about this graph:\nPros\n\nIt looks at the fluctuations in the amount of a particular data breach over a span of months per year based on monthly averages instead of over a span of days or weeks in order to fit all the data into the small space that the graph covers.\nIt ensures that the viewer and reader of this graph is able to distinguish which line refers to a specific data breach category by matching them based on color.\n\nCons\n\nUsing colors is not necessarily the best way to separate the lines from each other and match a specific data breach category with a specific line. It cannot be assumed that everybody has normal color vision. There are too many cool colors, especially green, blue, and different hues of purple that make it hard for the eye to focus and differentiate the lines from each other. On the light spectrum, the human eye can see the colors green pretty well and the color red fairly well, but not the color blue. We have fewer cones in our eyes that pick up the color blue and, as a result, have to focus more on texts and details that are in the color blue or blended in with a blue background.\nThe text of the data breach category “basic web application attacks” is in a bright yellow color that can make it hard to see and read.\n\nThe best solution for presenting this graph is to either incorporate some more warmer and brighter colors to provide more contrast and differentiation between the colors to help the viewer and reader distinguish which line belongs to which data breach category. Or, create different types of lines such as dotted and broken lines, for example, which I recommend, instead of colored lines."

    "title": "Review of Tufte’s Future of Data Analysis Presentation",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I watched a recorded video presentation by Dr. Edward Tufte from 2016 titled “The Future of Data Analysis.” It was a very insightful look into the changing landscape of the field of data analysis and data visualization. He provided some key findings of what all of us need and should strive for in the future in this field. Here are some notes and findings I highlighted from this presentation that I found very insightful:\n\nMost of us don’t think about this part of human history very much, but Gallileo, according to Dr. Tufte, was probably considered one of the greatest data thinking eyes to ever live. In his work of the Sidereus Nuncius, Gallileo illustrated the Pleiades cluster of stars in the sky that were visible, not with a telescope, but to the naked eye. Basically, it was a low-fidelity visualization of data points, the stars.\nProbably one of the most eye-opening and incredible data visualization graphics he showed was a graph showing the measles epidemic from a few decades back. It was split in half with the number of cases shown on the left without an available vaccine and the number of cases left after the vaccine. It was awe-inspiring the comparison being shown because there were hardly any data points for measles cases on the right side of the graph after a vaccine was provided. It showed the importance and power of vaccination. Here’s the graph:\n\n\nThe reason the measles incidence rate graphic was mind-blowing is it showed a “smart” comparison. Dr. Tufte points out that what we all need to strive for in the field of data visualization is not to make conclusions and findings, but to make smart comparisons by providing a better way of looking at the evidence that plain words and texts on paper are not able to do.\n\nThe only way to see big data is to see it. This ability in being able to see data has been greatly assisted by technological advances in screen-display quality of monitors. To clarify his point, he showed a map of the Swiss Alps that was put together to be seen on a screen-display and the contents were very clear and detailed. It was very easy on the eyes.\nThe greatest benefit about having musical scores and music being visualized through interactive colors and shapes is that it helps people with no musical abilities to make sense of the music and understand it is by relating elements of the music being heard and seen with tangible, visual patterns.\nMaps like Google Maps need to have light background colors in to for us to see the details and information laid out before us. It provides contrast.\nSometimes, it is best to capture everything in an instant replay video of a sports highlight or sequence of soccer plays, for example, on a one-page display in stop-action. It is a good way for one to learn and analyze another team’s performance, and strengths and weaknesses, if you are the athlete.\nIt is important to have an open mind, but not an empty head when analyzing data. This is because we want to avoid bias. If we do not, then the problem of fake publications, false-positives, and false-alarms will be an issue in our findings and conclusions of the data. The responsibility of data analytics is to get it right. This is why, for example, when analyzing human behavior that it is harder to replicate replication studies on human behavior and, thus, makes the analysis of human behavior harder than rocket science.\n\nAfter sharing all these invaluable pieces of insight, Dr. Tufte concluded his presentation by pointing out that you can have you own point of view, but not your own facts. He points out that we need to muck around in our data to discover what we did not know. He advises us to take a look a look at the “Quartz Guide to Bad Data” and not fall victim to biases such as “survival bias” where as a famous saying goes “Castles are not all made of stone. They are also made of wood.”"
